# Substring-Search
In this folder I demonstrate the Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp substring search algorithms through handwritten code or Java programs. I show how to build a deterministic finite-state automata and present multiple ways to search for a pattern in a text in O(n) time.
